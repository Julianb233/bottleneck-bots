================================================================================
IMMEDIATE ACTIONS
================================================================================

BEFORE LAUNCH (This Week):
  [ ] Get stakeholder approval to delay launch if Phase 1 not complete
  [ ] Assign Tessa (QA Lead) to Phase 1 coordination
  [ ] Create test data and fixtures
  [ ] Set up local test environment
  [ ] Begin P1.1 (Email/Password Auth) today

WEEK 1:
  [ ] Complete P1.1: Email/Password auth (8 tests)
  [ ] Complete P1.2: Google OAuth (6 tests)
  [ ] Complete P1.3: Password Reset (5 tests)
  [ ] Complete P1.4: Stripe Checkout (8 tests)
  [ ] Complete P1.5: Agent Execution (10 tests)
  [ ] Complete P1.6: Auth Protection (4 tests)

WEEK 2:
  [ ] Test all Phase 1 tests thoroughly
  [ ] Fix any bugs found
  [ ] Set up CI/CD integration
  [ ] Get stakeholder sign-off
  [ ] Deploy to production
  [ ] Monitor for issues

WEEK 3-4:
  [ ] Start Phase 2 implementation
  [ ] Monitor production metrics
  [ ] Gather customer feedback

================================================================================
KEY RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

1. DO NOT LAUNCH without Phase 1 completion
   - Risk of critical failures is too high
   - Missing auth alone means no users can access platform
   - Missing payments means no revenue

2. Invest in test infrastructure early
   - Helper functions save 40% of test writing time
   - Good setup prevents flaky tests
   - CI/CD integration catches regressions

3. Make E2E testing a team responsibility
   - Developers should write tests for their features
   - QA should lead and coordinate
   - Product should define user flows

4. Track test metrics continuously
   - % of features with E2E tests
   - Test execution time
   - Flaky test count
   - Production issues from untested code

5. Plan for ongoing maintenance
   - E2E tests require regular updates
   - UI changes break selectors
   - Database changes require fixture updates
   - 10% of feature time should go to test maintenance

================================================================================
SUCCESS CRITERIA
================================================================================

BEFORE LAUNCH:
  [ ] 40 Phase 1 tests implemented
  [ ] 100% Phase 1 tests passing
  [ ] 0 flaky tests
  [ ] CI/CD integration working
  [ ] Test execution < 30 minutes

WEEK 1-2 POST-LAUNCH:
  [ ] 0 critical bugs from untested flows
  [ ] 0 auth-related support tickets
  [ ] 0 payment-related issues
  [ ] Phase 2 tests > 50% complete

WEEK 3-4 POST-LAUNCH:
  [ ] Phase 2 tests complete
  [ ] 80%+ overall test coverage
  [ ] Regression test automation complete
  [ ] < 2 critical bugs per week
